# Project-3-JARS

### JARS

## Description

We have a developed a web app that allows Morgan State students to buy and sell textbooks with ease. Students who want to buy books can log in using their google emails and navigate to the store to view the currently added books. Students can also post books they would like to sell. JARS has set up a means for the buyer to contact the seller in order to make a purchase.

## Our Mission
To support students in need of purchasing affordable textbooks and create a self running textbook platform that is uncomplicated to navigate.

### Navigating JARS

- User can search for a book using the name, or ISBN number of the book.
- User can click the contact seller button next to a book's description in order to notify the seller of their interest in the book.
- User can click the sell a book link in order to add detailed information about the book they would like to sell.
- User can logout.

## Future Improvements
- We hope to allow users to upload photos of their textbooks so that students interested in purchasing books can view the textbooks.
- We also want students to be able to purchase textbooks directly off the JARS platform.
- We would like to create a way to verify the prices that students post for books. 
- We would like to users web session so that whenever they log in, their previous session is stored.
- Lastly, we would like our web app to be catered specifically towards Morgan state users and not just anyone with a Google login email.
