# Project-3-JARS

### JARS

## Description

We have a developed a web app that allows Morgan State students to buy and sell textbooks with ease. Students who want to buy books can log in using their google emails and navigate to the store to view the currently added books. Students can also post books they would like to sell. JARS has set up a means for the buyer to contact the seller in order to make a purchase.

## Our Purpose



## Getting started
- Install Flask
- Install npm
- Run 'npm run watch' from a terminal
- Run 'python app.py' from another terminal while running 'npm run watch'

### Built With:
- React- Fronted end
- Python- Serverside
- Flask- Microframework
- PostgreSQL- Database
- WebSocket (Socket.io)- For full duplex communication channel
- Additional libraries- flask_socketio, flask_sqlalchemy, psycopg2, requests, google.oauth2


## Future Improvements
- We hope to allow users to upload photos of their textbooks so that students interested in purchasing books can view the textbooks.
- We also want students to be able to purchase textbooks directly off the JARS platform.
- We would like to create a way to verify the prices that students post for books.
