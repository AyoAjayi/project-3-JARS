# Project-3-JARS

### JARS

## Description

We have a developed a web app that allows Morgan State students to buy and sell textbooks with ease. Students who want to buy books can log in using their google emails and navigate to the store to view the currently added books. Students can also post books they would like to sell. JARS has set up a means for the buyer to contact the seller in order to make a purchase.

## Getting started
- Install Flask
- Install npm
- Run 'npm run watch' from a terminal
- Run 'python app.py' from another terminal while running 'npm run watch'

### Built With:
- React- Fronted end
- Python- Serverside
- Flask- Microframework
- PostgreSQL- Database
- WebSocket (Socket.io)- For full duplex communication channel
- Additional libraries- flask_socketio, flask_sqlalchemy, psycopg2, requests, google.oauth2


## Future Improvements
- We hope to allow users to upload photos of their textbooks so that students interested in purchasing books can view the textbooks

## Resolution to Issues
- We can make our web app to redirect to marketplace page after successful login from user using react router.
- We need to create a better data model that identifies relationships between the different fields in our database.
- We will have to store the uploaded photo so we can render it to the client when a search occurs.
- We would need to look at the client side of our code to see where the issue is stemming from, since we are currently unsure
- We have to use react router to implement this into our web app.
